# Programme

The aim of the workshop is to give participants an introduction to version control with `git` for personal use. Although `git`, and websites/services such as [GitHub](github.com), provide advanced collaborative tools for writing code in groups, the focus of this workshop will be on "single user" use.

## Prerequisites (_a.k.a._ independent study prior to workshop)

[A PhD course](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics) was recently developed to introduce basic concepts of scientific computing. The course materials there were provided as [jupyter notebooks](jupyter.org), which can be viewed in their static form on GitHub (see links below).

### [an overview of scientific computing topics](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/01-Course-Overview.ipynb)

Not needed for the git-workshop, but here for completeness.

### [the command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/21-Command-line-interface.ipynb)

The motivation behind controlling a computer by typing commands rather than pointing and clicking with a mouse.

*It is assumed that you have at least cursory knowledge detailed on this page.* `git` is a _command line utility_, and you will need to be able to navigate the [file system](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/12-Files-and-filesystems.ipynb) of your computer (or a `hyades` server via Remote Desktop).

### [more advanced CLI usage](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/22-Working-on-command-line.ipynb)

Take a look at copying/moving files, and making/removing directories.

## Version control systems

### [What is version control (VS)?](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

And why you should use it.

## Introduction to git

* What is git?
* Why use git vs other version control systems?
* Git work flow
	- git status
	- git commit
	- git log
	- repositories
	- git pull/push
	- branches

## Introduction to GitHub

* What is GitHub?
* Using GH

- mje: what else should be here?


## Suggestions for standardised work flow

* Show a schematic of a standard work flow that can be applied to must projects
