## Prerequisites (_a.k.a._ independent study prior to workshop)

[A PhD course](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics) was recently developed to introduce basic concepts of scientific computing. The course materials there were provided as [jupyter notebooks](jupyter.org), which can be viewed in their static form on GitHub (see links below).

### [an overview of scientific computing topics](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/01-Course-Overview.ipynb)

Not needed for the git-workshop, but here for completeness.

### [the command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/21-Command-line-interface.ipynb)

The motivation behind controlling a computer by typing commands rather than pointing and clicking with a mouse.

*It is assumed that you have at least cursory knowledge detailed on this page.* `git` is a _command line utility_, and you will need to be able to navigate the [file system](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/12-Files-and-filesystems.ipynb) of your computer (or a `hyades` server via Remote Desktop).

### [more advanced CLI usage](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/22-Working-on-command-line.ipynb)

Take a look at copying/moving files, and making/removing directories.
