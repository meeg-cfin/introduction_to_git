# Prerequisites 


To ensure a smooth start, please make sure 
to look through the following issues beforehand:

## 1) Make yourself familiar with the terminal
If you are not a terminal user already, please have a look at the 
following resources here on the CFIN Github page - you should be comfortable 
with the idea of working on the command line:
* [The command line interface](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/21-Command-line-interface.ipynb)
* [Working on the command line](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics/blob/master/notebooks/22-Working-on-command-line.ipynb)

Those scripts belong to a [PhD course](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics) that was recently developed to introduce basic concepts of scientific computing. The course materials there were provided as [jupyter notebooks](jupyter.org), which can be viewed in their static form on GitHub.

## 2) Install Git to your computer
Please install the version control system Git to your computer before 
the course (and/or make sure you 
have a reasonably up-to-date version of Git).
Guidelines and help on how to do this can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
